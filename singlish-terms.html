    <h1>Words from the Creole English of Singapore and Southern Malaysia</h1>
    <p>I have a knack for sprinkling words in my everyday speech that originated from Malay, Hokkien and Cantonese in the same way that many Chinese people in the Southern Malaysian Peninsular speak colloquially. Here is a list of words I use as well as their meaning, as I myself struggle to recall the proper English terms (which is why I would use them in the first place!).</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Aiya: See hai-ah</li>
