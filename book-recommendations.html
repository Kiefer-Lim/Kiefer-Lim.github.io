    <h1>Maths and Physics Books I love</h1>
    <p>Here is my suggested readings for highly motivated students who want to learn maths and physics, in order and from the very beginning (right after primary school level mathematics), which I had enjoyed or had hoped I've learned about beforehand! I like these books because their style suits me; sufficiently rigorous without being overly pedantic, while motivating new topics skilfully so that every encounter feels fresh and interesting.</p>
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, obviously Murderous Maths books to get you excited!</li>
      <li><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/list/all-products">Art of Problem Solving</a> (AoPS) books. These are too goated; I would eat up every single chapter that interests you, which may be the whole thing, and these topics (apart from number theory maybe) is foundational to every mathematician and physicist's toolbox, so don't be stingy with them. Problems are quite interesting too, taken from maths competitions.
        <ul>
          <li>Prealgebra</li>
          <li>Introduction to Algebra</li>
          <li>Introduction to Probability and Counting</li>
          <li>Introduction to Geometry</li>
          <li>Introduction to Number Theory</li>
          <li>Intermediate Algebra</li>
          <li>Intermediate Counting and Probability</li>
          <li>Precalculus</li>
          <li>Calculus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For understanding proofs and logic (not needed until real and complex analysis), I liked this Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking">Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</a>, which also has a <a href="http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~portosil/curso-Devlin.pdf">book</a> to it.</li>
      <li>For a first course in Multivariable Calculus I recommend <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/">MIT OCW 18.02SC</a>. I love Denis Auroux's clear explanations and blackboard erasing skill. This is where I first truly understood vector and matrices, and goes into vector calculus and multiple integrals. You can complement this with 3blue1brown's Essence of Linear Algebra, which is such a good course, pretty much the whole thing is super enlightening, and the only place which I didn't understand the first time round is the idea of linearity corresponding to operations that keep straight lines straight, but that's about it.</li>
      <li>For Ordinary Differential equations, after seeing the material in the last chapter of AoPS, check out Professor Schekochihin's <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/ODE/">ODEs webpage</a>, <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/ODE/2018/ODELectureNotes.pdf">especially his lecture notes</a> which is what we used in Oxford in 2023.</li> Very insightful, you probably don't need the whole thing and some parts are a little too advanced for me, but I learned a lot even from the parts I understood. 
      <li>For more Linear Algebra, I like Jim Hefferon's <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/12921/book.pdf">Linear Algebra book</a>, available freely online. If you want to look at linear algebra from a more rigorous proofs POV, I'd recommend Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right as your second linear algebra course.</li>
      <li>For a pretty good learning/reference book on the mathematical tools for undergraduate physics, I like James Nearing's <a href="https://www.ge.infn.it/apetrolini/FisGen/JNearing-MathematicalMethodsForPhysics.pdf">Mathematical Tools for Physics</a>, which was available free on Nearing's website until it disappeared :( . Important topics you should check out are: Gaussian Integrals, Gamma functions, Fourier Series, PDEs, Complex Analysis, Calculus of Variations, and Delta functions.</li>
      <li>For Complex Analysis, I love Visual Complex Analysis by Tristan Needham. Excellent book that has a less rigorous but still engaging and very geometrical approach, very suitable for someone like me who enjoys maths Olympiad type problems (even if I'm not very good at them!). Knowing complex numbers is going to be very handy, while some geometry will be super helpful, mostly on theorems about angles in circles. </li>
      <li>For a real analysis book, by far the best one I've seen is Abbott's Understanding Analysis. Highly recommended after the Coursera course "Introduction to Mathematical Thinking". </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>Here are physics books I love and recommend.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physics for the Inquiring Mind by Eric Rogers! Can be read after learning just algebra and elementary geometry.</li>
        <li>Physics (5th edition) by Halliday Resnick Krane. The bible for physics Olympiad books! Recommend after learning calculus (important) and some vector calculus (recommended), as well as having done an introductory physics course such as Physics for the Inquiring Mind, or GCSE/O Level physics.</li>
        <li>David Morin Classical Mechanics. Honestly a really good book, with really fun problems: don't be discouraged by them! Check out the solution if you get stuck and thinking about the problem isn't fun anymore, then check the solution. His website also has an extra chapter on Hamiltonian mechanics if you enjoy this kind of stuff.</li>
        <li>Griffiths Electrodynamics. Everyone and I love this book, even if it's mathematically quite dense. You must have a good grounding in multivariable calculus [MIT OCW 18.02SC], and also read about the delta function in Nearing's Math Tools for Physics in the Distributions chapter. </li>
        <li>Schroeder Introduction to Thermal Physics. Really cute book. You'll need some combinatorics tricks, which you can pick up from the first few chapters of AoPS Introduction to Counting and Probability, or G'Day Maths <a href="https://gdaymath.com/courses/permutations-and-combinations/">Permutations and Combinations</a> course. After this and you'd like to learn in more depth, I would recommend learning some classical thermodynamics from somewhere (if anyone have a good recommendation, let me know! Oxford uses Devriendt's Thermal Physics <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/system/files/file_attachments/all_thermo_notes.pdf">lecture notes</a>), then read Schekochihin's own Kinetic Theory and Statistical Mechanics <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/A1/">lecture notes</a>.</li>
        <li>I'm planning on checking out Shankar's Quantum Mechanics, and I'll let you know how good it is. I like Lvovsky's Quantum Physics: An introduction based on photons. </li>
      </ul>
