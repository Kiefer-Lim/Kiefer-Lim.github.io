    <h1>Maths and Physics Books I love</h1>
    <p>Here is my suggested readings for highly motivated students who want to learn maths and physics, in order and from the very beginning (right after primary school level mathematics), which I had enjoyed or had hoped I've learned about beforehand!</p>
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, ovbiously Murderous Maths books to get you excited!</li>
      <li><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/list/all-products">Art of Problem Solving</a> (AoPS) books. These are too goated; I would eat up every single chapter that interests you, which may be the whole thing, and these topics (apart from number theory maybe) is foundational to every mathematician and physicist's toolbox, so don't be stingy with them. Problems are quite interesting too, taken from maths competitions.
        <ul>
          <li>Prealgebra</li>
          <li>Introduction to Algebra</li>
          <li>Introduction to Probability and Counting</li>
          <li>Introduction to Geometry</li>
          <li>Introduction to Number Theory</li>
          <li>Intermediate Algebra</li>
          <li>Intermediate Counting and Probability</li>
          <li>Precalculus</li>
          <li>Calculus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For understanding proofs and logic, I liked this Coursera course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking">Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</a>, which also has a <a href="http://www.mat.ufrgs.br/~portosil/curso-Devlin.pdf">book</a> to it.</li>
      <li>For a first course in Multivariable Calculus I recommend <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/">MIT OCW 18.02SC</a>. I love Denis Auroux's clear explanations and blackboard erasing skill. This is where I first truly understood vector and matrices, and goes into vector calculus and multiple integrals. </li>
      <li>For Ordinary Differential equations, after seeing the material in the last chapter of AoPS, check out Professor Schekochihin's <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/ODE/">ODEs webpage</a>, <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/ODE/2018/ODELectureNotes.pdf">especially his lecture notes</a> which is what we used in Oxford in 2023.</li> Very insightful, you probably don't need the whole thing and some parts are a little too advanced for me, but I learned a lot even from the parts I understood. 
      <li>For Linear Algebra, I like Jim Hefferon's <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/12921/book.pdf">Linear Algebra book</a>, available freely online. If you want to look at linear algebra from a more rigorous proofs POV, I'd recommend  as your second linear algebra course.</li>
      <li>For a pretty good learning/reference book on the mathematical tools for undergraduate physics, I like James Nearing's <a href="https://www.ge.infn.it/apetrolini/FisGen/JNearing-MathematicalMethodsForPhysics.pdf">Mathematical Tools for Physics</a>, which was available free on Nearing's website until it disappeared :( I also like the Maths Methods taught in Oxford's 2nd year physics, notes are <a href="https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AndreLukas/MathMeth/mmlecturenotes.pdf">here</a>. Important topics you should check out are: Gaussian Integrals, Gamma functions, Fourier Series, PDEs, Complex Analysis, Calculus of Variations, and Delta functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p>Here are </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physics for the Inquiring Mind by Eric Rogers</li>
        <li>Physics (5th edition) by Halliday Resnick Krane</li>
      </ul>
